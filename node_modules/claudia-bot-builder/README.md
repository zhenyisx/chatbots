_Claudia Bot Builder_ helps developers create and deploy chat-bots for various platforms in minutes to AWS Lambda. It simplifies the messaging workflows, automatically sets up the correct web hooks, and guides you through configuration steps, so that you can focus on important business problems and not have to worry about infrastructure code.

Check out [this two minute video](https://vimeo.com/170647056) to see how you can create and deploy a bot quickly:

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
const botBuilder = require('claudia-bot-builder');
const excuse = require('huh');

module.exports = botBuilder(function (request) {
  return 'Thanks for sending ' + request.text +
    'Your message is very important to us, but ' +
    excuse.get();
});
```

This code is enough to operate bots for all four supported platforms. Claudia Bot Builder automatically parses the incoming messages into a common format, so you can handle it easily. It also automatically packages the response into the correct message template for the requesting bot, so you do not have to worry about individual bot protocols.

## Supported platforms

* Facebook Messenger 
* Slack (channel slash commands and apps with slash commands) 
* Skype
* Telegram

## Frequently asked questions

1. **How to run it locally?**

   You can't. At least not easy. Claudia Bot Builder doesn't have a stand alone http server in the background (such as Express, Hapi, etc.), instead it uses API Gateway and it's not trivial to simulate similar environment locally.

2. **How to test your bot?**

   Your chat bot is just a Lambda function, which means it is just a simple JavaScript function and you should be able to, at least in theory, run everything locally as simple automated tests.
   
   The most important thing is to design testable Lambda functions, [this guide](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/designing-testable-lambdas.html) will help you to do that.
   
   Integration tests can be a bit more complex if you have some integrations with external or AWS services. Check [this guide](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/testing-locally.html) to see how to write integration tests and run automated tests locally.
   
3. **My Facebook messenger bot responds to my messages only. Why it's not responding to everyone?**

   Facebook has [a review process](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/app-review) for chat bots. Make sure your bot is approved.
   
4. **Can I send Slack slash command delayed responses?**

   Yes, here's [the tutorial for that](https://claudiajs.com/tutorials/slack-delayed-responses.html).
